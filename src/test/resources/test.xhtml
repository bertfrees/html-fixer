<p class="C125"><strong><small>HOME-STYLE COOKING,</small></strong> the neon sign said. I was very hungry, but something about the diner made me hesitate and stop just inside the doorway. Red vinyl-topped chrome stools, the kind you can spin around on, were tucked under a long Formica counter. Black menus in chrome holders matched the napkin dispensers and the shiny salt and vinegar containers. Each booth along one wall displayed a chrome and glass control for the Wurlitzer jukebox that squatted in the corner: three plays for a quarter. The place smelled of onions and the hot fat in the deep fryer. I could watch the cook put my order together. I got over my hesitation and took a seat at the counter. The restaurant was empty, except for the cook, and she didn&#x2019;t say anything to me, just kept polishing glasses with a white cloth. I picked up a menu. The specials were handwritten on a piece of paper taped inside: Salisbury steak or liver and onions, a choice of blueberry or cherry pie for desert. The soup of the day was navy bean. I was too hungry to think, so I ordered a deluxe burger with fries, and for ten cents extra I got mushrooms.</p>
<p class="C129">With one quick motion of the cook&#x2019;s hand, the patty hit the grill with a satisfying sizzle. The cook carefully opened the bun and placed it beside the patty. She hadn&#x2019;t said one word the whole time, and her silence was beginning to make me uncomfortable. But before I could think about it too long, the burger was ready. She slid it to me across the counter. It was fresh and juicy, with lettuce and tomatoes spilling onto a big side of fries. I picked it up with both hands and took a huge bite.</p>
<p class="C129"><a id="page_2"/>My mouth closed onto something sharp and metallic. A tremendous jerk from the burger lifted me right off the stool and up toward the ceiling. The diner disappeared and I found myself underwater being pulled toward the surface.</p>
<p class="C129">I tried to move my hands but couldn&#x2019;t make them work. I kicked my legs but they felt strange; looking down I saw they had changed to fins. I started to thrash about wildly. A dark shape loomed above me. As I was dragged closer I saw two people smiling down at me. One of them was holding something. The other looked like the cook from the diner. I didn&#x2019;t think they had my best interests in mind. I knew if they brought me to the surface it would mean my death.</p>
<p class="C129">I gave one last desperate shake of my head and woke up, sweating, in my bed.</p>
